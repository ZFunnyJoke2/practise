                The Sopranos is a crime drama TV series created by David Chase, and
                widely recognized as one of the greatest series of all time.

                It follows protagonist Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), a New Jersey
                -based Italian-American mob boss, who struggles to manage his family and
                criminal life. Suffering from panic attacks, Tony attends therapy sessions
                with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), whom he confides in.

                Throughout the six seasons of the series, Tony has to contend with his
                uncle, Junior (Dominic Chianese); his wife, Carmela (Edie Falco); and
                threats from mobsters both within the family and external, such as the
                New York City-based Lupertazzi family.

                A prequel film to The Sopranos has been confirmed. Titled The Many Saints
                of Newark, it centers on the 1967
                Newark riots and will feature a young Tony Soprano (Michael Gandolfini),
                among other characters. The film was
                released on September 24, 2021.
